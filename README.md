# Onceler

"*How ba-a-a-ad can I be?*"

Cutting down the Lorax since 2021.

Onceler is a wrapper for Lorax that allows for advanced image composition similar to Pungi.

Instead of writing a bunch of long command line arguments, you can use Onceler and a config file to compose your images, similar to Pungi but without the need to use Koji.
